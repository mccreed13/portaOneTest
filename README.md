Program counts maximal, minimal, average, median number.
Also finds the biggest minimal and maximal orders from whole file.

To set own file with numbers, you should set it full path in file.properties in file.path. Please enter a path like this:
'Disk name':/.../'File name'. Example: C:/Users/alapu/Downloads/10m.txt.
If you add file in repository root, just set only filename with extension. Example: filename.txt.
